# TODO
- [X] come up with a clever name for project
- [ ] identify docs/required reading
- [ ] create some concept art and decide on final key % / layout / any custom inputs
- [ ] prototype with existing esp32 dev kit

## research targets
- ideally:  esp32 with usbc + battery charging circuit + bluetooth
- rgb led lumans / power consumption
- battery requirements
- battery charging process / pcb design vs pre-made module
- esp32 soc size / existing pre-made module potentially with battery charging built in?
