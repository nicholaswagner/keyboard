# TODO
- [X] come up with a clever name for project
- [ ] identify docs/required reading
- [ ] create some concept art and decide on final key % / layout / any custom inputs
- [ ] prototype with existing esp32 dev kit

## research targets
- ideally:  esp32 with usbc + battery charging circuit + bluetooth
- rgb led lumans / power consumption
- battery requirements
- battery charging process / pcb design vs pre-made module
- esp32 soc size / existing pre-made module potentially with battery charging built in?

- [usb-c liPoly charger?](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4410)

- [potential RGB leds?](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32966375934.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dv4DTiK)

Currently using this for prototyping
- [esp32 prototype] (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32906857429.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dv4DTiK)

Might consider the feather line for final build
